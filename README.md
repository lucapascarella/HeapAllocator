# MyAlloc
MyAlloc is a optimized and portable heap memory allocator.

## Description
This project implements a custom and optimized version of a dynamic memory allocator designed to fit into PIC32MZ2064DAH176 microcontroller and provide a simplified access to the internal DDR2 RAM memory.
The project is developed on MAC OS and tested with a PIC32MZ2064DAH176 real environment.

The cache _CACHE_LINE_SIZE_ (set to 16 bytes) respects the cache line alignment of PIC32MZ2064DAH176.
